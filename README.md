- Context API for state management
- Custom hooks for audio control
- TypeScript for type safety
- Performance optimizations with React.memo and useMemo

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **AudioContext**: Central state management for audio operations
- **WaveformDisplay**: Container for track display and interactions
- **Track**: Individual track component with waveform and timeline
- **PlaybackControls**: Universal controls for playback management

### Key Features Implementation
- **Synchronized Playback**: HTML5 Audio elements with precise timing
- **Anti-clipping Timeline**: Uses `calc()` positioning to prevent label cutoff
- **Modern Positioning**: All interactive elements use consistent anti-clipping formulas
- **Performance Optimized**: React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback throughout
